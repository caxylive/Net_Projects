# VLAN Concepts

---

## Introduction
VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) are a fundamental concept in networking that allow network segmentation without requiring separate physical infrastructure. This document provides an overview of VLAN concepts, their benefits, and their use cases.

## What is a VLAN?
A VLAN is a logical grouping of devices within a network, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same physical network, even if they are not. VLANs are implemented at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.

## Benefits of VLANs
- **Network Segmentation**: Reduces broadcast traffic and enhances performance.
- **Security**: Isolates traffic between groups to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Flexibility**: Devices can be grouped based on function rather than physical location.
- **Better Traffic Management**: VLANs help reduce congestion by segmenting network traffic.

## Types of VLANs
1. **Default VLAN**: The initial VLAN present on a switch (usually VLAN 1).
2. **Data VLAN**: Used for carrying user-generated traffic.
3. **Voice VLAN**: Dedicated for VoIP traffic to ensure Quality of Service (QoS).
4. **Management VLAN**: Used for network management traffic.
5. **Native VLAN**: The VLAN assigned to untagged frames.

## VLAN Tagging
- VLANs use tagging to identify traffic belonging to specific VLANs.
- **802.1Q** is the most common tagging protocol.
- Switches use VLAN IDs (VID) to distinguish between VLANs.

## Inter-VLAN Communication
By default, VLANs cannot communicate with each other. Inter-VLAN routing is required, which can be done using:
- **Router-on-a-stick**: A router with a trunk connection handling multiple VLANs.
- **Layer 3 Switches**: Switches with routing capabilities.

## Conclusion
Understanding VLANs is crucial for network engineers and administrators. They provide security, efficiency, and scalability to modern networks. For practical implementation details, refer to the VLAN Configuration document.
