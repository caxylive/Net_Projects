In a networking context, switches handle frames in different VLANs by using a tagging system, specifically IEEE 802.1Q. Here's how it works:

  1) VLAN Separation: Each VLAN is treated as a separate broadcast domain. Frames sent from devices in one VLAN cannot directly communicate with devices in another VLAN unless routed through a Layer 3 device (like a router).

  2) VLAN Tagging: When a frame enters a switch port that is configured for a VLAN, the switch tags the frame with the VLAN identifier (ID). The tagging process adds a four-byte field to the original Ethernet frame. This is known as the VLAN tag, allowing the switch to identify which VLAN the frame belongs to.

  3) Trunking Protocol: To allow multiple VLANs to traverse a single physical link between switches, trunking protocols (such as 802.1Q) are employed. This enables switches to carry traffic from multiple VLANs across the same connection.

  3) Frame Handling: When a tagged frame reaches a switch, the switch examines the VLAN ID in the tag. It then forwards the frame only to ports that belong to the same VLAN. If the frameâ€™s VLAN does not match the port's configured VLAN, the frame is dropped, ensuring logical separation between VLANs.

  4) Cross-Switch Communication: For two switches to communicate VLAN information, a trunk port must be established between them. This port will use the trunking protocol to ensure frames from different VLANs are correctly tagged and forwarded.

In summary, VLAN tagging and trunking are crucial for switches to manage and route frames effectively between different VLANs while keeping traffic isolated.
