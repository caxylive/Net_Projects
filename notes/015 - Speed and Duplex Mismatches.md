### Lesson Summary

In this CCNA lesson, the instructor is demonstrating the issue of duplex mismatches between a router and switches. Here’s a summarized walkthrough:

1. **Ping Test**:
    - The instructor pings router 2 from router 1, and the pings succeed.
    - Despite successful pings, there's a message indicating a duplex mismatch between router 1 and switch 2950-1.

2. **Identification of Duplex Mismatches**:
    - The instructor points out duplex mismatches on specific interfaces: fast ethernet 0/3 (connected to router 1) and fast ethernet 0/4 (connected to switch 2950-2).
    - These duplex mismatches are causing network performance issues.

3. **Using Tools for Monitoring**:
    - The instructor suggests using tools like Syslog servers or management applications (e.g., SolarWinds) to monitor and identify such issues.

4. **Extended Ping Test**:
    - An extended ping test with large datagram sizes is conducted to simulate high traffic.
    - As a result, late collision messages appear, indicating duplex mismatch problems.

5. **Configuration Details**:
    - The instructor shows the interface configurations:
        - On the switch: speed set to 10 Mbps, full duplex.
        - On the router: speed set to 100 Mbps, half duplex (due to negotiation failure).

6. **Observations**:
    - When high traffic is sent on the half duplex connection, late collisions occur.
    - On the full duplex side, input errors like CRC errors or runt frames are observed.

7. **Conclusion**:
    - The lesson highlights how duplex mismatches lead to network performance issues, such as drops, poor throughput, and collisions.
    - Monitoring tools can help identify and resolve these issues effectively.

The key takeaway is that duplex mismatches, often due to auto-negotiation failures or manual configuration mismatches, can severely impact network performance, especially under heavy traffic conditions. Monitoring and proper configuration are essential to prevent such issues.

### SOLUTION

Using the same type of cable can help avoid some issues, but it's not the only solution to fix duplex mismatches. The key steps to resolving duplex mismatch problems include:

1. **Consistent Configuration**:
    - Ensure both devices (router and switch) are configured with the same duplex mode and speed settings. This means both should be set to either half duplex or full duplex and the same speed (e.g., 100 Mbps).

2. **Proper Cabling**:
    - Use high-quality, compatible cables. Make sure the cables match the devices' requirements (e.g., Cat5 or Cat6 for 100BASE-TX).

3. **Manual Configuration**:
    - Manually configure the duplex and speed settings on both devices if auto-negotiation fails. This ensures that both sides agree on the same settings.

4. **Monitoring Tools**:
    - Use network management tools like those from SolarWinds to detect and resolve duplex mismatches and other network issues.

While using the same type of cable is important, ensuring that both devices are configured consistently and monitoring the network for issues are equally crucial steps in preventing and resolving duplex mismatches.

To resolve duplex mismatch issues, you'll need to ensure that both devices (router and switch) have compatible configurations. This involves using the appropriate commands on both devices to set the speed and duplex settings consistently. Here's a recap:

| Description of Command      | Router Command                        | Switch Command                        |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Enter Interface Configuration Mode | `int f0/3`                     | `int f0/3`                            |
| Set Speed to Auto-Negotiate | `speed auto`                          | `speed auto`                          |
| Set Duplex to Auto-Negotiate| `duplex auto`                         | `duplex auto`                         |
| Verify Configuration        | `sh run int f0/3`                     | `sh run int f0/3`                     |

By ensuring both devices are set to auto-negotiate the speed and duplex settings, you can prevent mismatches and improve network performance. If auto-negotiation fails, you may need to manually set both devices to the same speed and duplex mode.

### RUNT FRAMES

Runt frames are Ethernet frames that are smaller than the minimum frame size defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard. Specifically, a runt frame is any frame that is less than 64 bytes in length. These frames are typically caused by collisions on the network, especially in a half-duplex Ethernet environment.

In a properly functioning Ethernet network, frames should be at least 64 bytes long to ensure reliable communication. When a frame is smaller than this minimum size, it is considered a runt and is usually discarded by network devices because it indicates a problem, such as a collision or a malfunctioning network interface card.

When devices fail to properly auto-negotiate their speed and duplex settings, they often default to a more conservative mode to ensure basic connectivity. This default can be 10 Mbps and half duplex, especially with older devices.

Here’s a brief recap from the transcript:
- The router, unable to negotiate with the switch, defaulted to 10 Mbps half duplex.
- The switch was set to 10 Mbps full duplex.

This mismatch led to performance issues, such as collisions and errors, under high traffic conditions. Ensuring proper auto-negotiation or manually configuring compatible settings on both devices is crucial to prevent such problems.

---

The reason why the router defaulted to 10 Mbps half duplex while the switch defaulted to 10 Mbps full duplex isn't due to a programming error, but rather to historical design decisions and how auto-negotiation works.

Here's a bit of context:

1. Historical Design:
    - Originally, Ethernet networks were half-duplex, using hubs to connect devices. In this environment, 10 Mbps half duplex was the norm.
    - As technology evolved, switches replaced hubs, allowing full-duplex communication, which eliminates collisions and improves performance.

2. Auto-Negotiation:
    - Auto-negotiation is a process where devices share their capabilities (speed and duplex) and agree on the best mode of operation.
    - If auto-negotiation fails, devices often fall back to a "safe mode" to ensure basic connectivity. This fallback is often 10 Mbps half duplex because it's a widely supported mode, even by older devices.

3. Fallback Mechanism:
    - When a device (like the router) fails to negotiate successfully, it defaults to 10 Mbps half duplex to ensure it can still communicate at a basic level.
    - Newer switches, designed for full duplex operation, may not always fall back to half duplex, resulting in a mismatch.

4. Configuration Variability:
    - Devices may have different default configurations based on their design and intended use. This can lead to mismatches if not properly configured.

Using the clear counters <interface> command can help you identify problems by resetting the interface statistics and then observing the new data collected. Here's how you can use it effectively:

1. Clear Counters:
First, clear the counters for the specific interface to reset the statistics. For example:
``` Cisco_IOS
Router# clear counters fastethernet 0/3
```

2. Monitor and Gather Data:
After clearing the counters, monitor the interface for a period of time to gather new statistics. This allows you to see the errors and issues that occur from this point forward.

3. Show Interface Statistics:
Check the interface statistics after some time to see if any new errors or issues have been recorded. For example:
```Cisco_IOS
Router# show interfaces fastethernet 0/3
```

Here’s an example output of the show interfaces command after clearing the counters and gathering new data:
```Cisco_IOS
Router# show interfaces fastethernet 0/3
FastEthernet0/3 is up, line protocol is up 
  Hardware is Fast Ethernet, address is 000a.b755.b301 (bia 000a.b755.b301)

```

In this example output, you can observe various statistics for the interface, such as input errors, CRC errors, collisions, etc. By clearing the counters and then monitoring the interface, you can spot recurring issues and identify the root causes more effectively.

When you clear the counters and then use the show interfaces command to check the interface statistics, here are some key metrics you should focus on:

1. Input Errors:
Look for the "input errors" counter. High numbers here can indicate problems with receiving data on the interface.

2. CRC Errors:
The "CRC" counter shows cyclic redundancy check errors. These errors occur when the data has been corrupted during transmission.

3. Frame Errors:
Frame errors indicate that the received frames have incorrect lengths or formatting issues.

4. Overruns:
Overruns occur when the interface receives more data than it can handle, leading to dropped packets.

5. Ignored Packets:
Ignored packets are those that have been dropped due to buffer overflow or other issues.

6. Collisions:
Look for "collisions," "late collisions," and "deferred transmissions." These counters are particularly important in half-duplex environments where collisions can cause significant performance issues.

7. Output Errors:
Check for "output errors," which indicate problems with transmitting data from the interface.

8. Runts and Giants:
Runts are frames that are too small (less than 64 bytes), and giants are frames that are too large. Both indicate potential issues with data transmission.

9. Buffer Overflows:
Buffer overflow counters show how often the interface buffer was full and couldn't accept more data.

Here’s a simplified example of the key sections you might see in the output:
```Cisco_IOS
FastEthernet0/3 is up, line protocol is up 
  Hardware is Fast Ethernet, address is 000a.b755.b301 (bia 000a.b755.b301)
  Full-duplex, 100Mb/s, 100BaseTX/FX
  ...
  0 input errors, 0 CRC, 0 frame, 0 overrun, 0 ignored
  ...
  0 output errors, 0 collisions, 0 interface resets
  ...
```

You want to look for any non-zero values in these counters, as they can indicate issues that need to be addressed. By focusing on these key metrics, you can better understand what might be going wrong on the interface and take appropriate action to resolve the problems.
